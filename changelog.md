### CAMT.053 support

GitHub user @beatbesmer has been working hard to make the data importer support CAMT.053 files. You can now upload 
these files like you would a CSV file and have them imported into Firefly III. Although this new feature has been
thorougly tested by Beat and myself, CAMT.053's XML standards are a very loose standard so expect bugs, issues and
crashes. We welcome your feedback in the form of [bug reports](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug.yml)
