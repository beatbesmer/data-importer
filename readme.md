## About this data importer

"Firefly III" is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. The **data importer** is built to help you import transactions into Firefly III. It is separated from Firefly III for security and maintenance reasons.

The data importer does not connect to your bank directly. Instead, it uses [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/) and [SaltEdge](https://www.saltedge.com/products/spectre/countries) to connect to over 6000 banks worldwide. These services are free for Firefly III users, but require registration. Keep in mind these services have their own privacy and data usage policies.

The data importer can also connect to your bank using `SimpleFIN`, and it can import CSV/camt.053 files you've downloaded from your bank.

You can run the data importer once, for a bulk import. You can also run it regularly to keep up with new transactions.

Eager to get started? Go to [the documentation](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/)!

## Features

* Import from over 6000 banks
* Import over the command line for easy automation
* Import over an API for easy automation
* Use rules and data mapping for transaction clarity

Many more features are listed in the [documentation](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/).

## Who's it for?

This application is for people who want to track their finances, keep an eye on their money **without having to upload their financial records to the cloud**. You're a bit tech-savvy, you like open source software, and you don't mind tinkering with (self-hosted) servers.
